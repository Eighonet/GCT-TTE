Welcome to the official repo of the GCT-TTE model -- transformer-based travel time estimation algorithm. Here we present the source code of the pipeline and demo application.

You can access the inference of our model at [gctte.online](http://gctte.online)

arXiv PDF: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04324 

# Prerequisites 

**Backend:** please use *application/requirements.txt* in order to compile the environment for the application. 

**Model:** the experiments were conducted with `CUDA 10.1` and `torch 1.8.1`. The following libraries must be compatible with this software setup:
```
- torch-cluster==1.6.0
- torch-geometric==2.1.0.post1
- torch-scatter==2.0.8
- torch-sparse==0.6.12
- torch-spline-conv==1.2.1
```
All other external libraries, which do not depend on `torch` and `CUDA` versions, are mentioned in `/model/requirements.txt`.

# Local tests

Launch instructions are provided [in the README file](https://github.com/Eighonet/GCT-TTE/tree/main/model) of the `/model` directory.

# Datasets

We provide two datasets corresponding to the cities of Abakan and Omsk. For each of these datasets, there are two types of target values -- real travel time (considered in this study) and real length of trip. 

<table>
<tr><th>Road network</th><th>Trips</th></tr>

|Edges| 340012 |  1149492 |
|Clustering| 0.5278 | 0.53 |
