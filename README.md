Welcome to the official repo of the GCT-TTE model -- transformer-based travel time estimation algorithm. Here we present the source code of the pipeline and dedicated application.

You can access inference of our model at [gcttte.online](http://gctte.online)

arXiv PDF: to be added

# Prerequisites

**Backend:** please use *application/requirements.txt* in order to compile the environemnt for application. 

**Model:**

```

# Local test


# Datasets

We provide two datasets corresponding to the cities of Abakan and Omsk. For each of these datasets, there are two types of target values -- real travel time (considered in this study) and real length of trip. 

<table>
